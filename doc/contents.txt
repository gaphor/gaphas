Gaphas Documentation
====================

Gaphas is Gaphor's diagram drawing widget.

Gaphas has been built with some extensibility in mind. It can be used for many
drawing purposes, including vector drawing applications, diagram drawing tools
and we even have a geographical map demo in our repository.

The basic idea is:

- Items can be added to an Item Container.
- An Item Container can be visualized by one or more Views.
- The item container maintains the tree structure (parent-child relationships between
  items).
- A constraint solver is used to maintain item constraints and inter-item
  constraints.
- The item (and user) should not be bothered with things like bounding-box
  calculations.
- Very modular: e.g. handle support could be swapped in and swapped out.
- Rendering using Toga_.

Gaphas is released under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License
(LGPL).

Gaphas has been build using `setuptools` and can be installed as Python Egg.
