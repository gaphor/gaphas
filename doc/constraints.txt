Constraints
===========
Introduction
------------
There are problems related to canvas items, which can be solved in
`declarative way <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming>`_
allowing for simpler and less error prone implementation of canvas item.

For example, if an item should be a rectangle, then it could be declared
that

- bottom-right vertex should be below and on the right side of top-left
  vertex
- two top rectangle vertices should be always at the same y-axis
- two left rectangle vertices should be always at the same x-axis
- ...

Above rules are constraints, which need to be applied to a rectangular
item. The rules can be satisfied (constraints can be solved) using
`constraint solver <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem>`_.

Gaphas implements its own constraint solver (`gaphas.solver` module).
Items can be constrained using APIs defined in `ItemContainer` and `Item` classes.

Constraints API
---------------
The `ItemContainer` class constraints API supports adding a constraint to
constraint solver.  Instance of a constraint has to be created and then
added using `ItemContainer.add_constraint` method. For example, it allows to
declare that two variables should be equal.

The `Item` class constraint API is more abstract, it allows to constraint
positions, i.e.

- positions of two item handles should be on the same x-axis
- position should be always on a line

If this API does not provide some constraint declaration, then one can
fallback to `ItemContainer` class constraint API.
