Gaphas
======

Gaphor's Canvas.

This module contains the application independent parts of Gaphor's
Canvas.

Notes
=====

In py-cairo 1.8.0 (or 1.8.1, or 1.8.2) the multiplication order has
been reverted. This causes bugs in Gaphas.

Also a new method ``multiply()`` has been introduced. This method is
used in Gaphas instead of the multiplier (``*``). In both the
``Canvas`` and ``View`` class a workaround is provided in case an
older version of py-cairo is used.
